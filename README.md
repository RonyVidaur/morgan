## GraphQL Features

- Strongly typed - you can validate a query syntactically and within the GraphQL type system before execution. This also helps leverage powerful tools that improve the development experience, such as GraphiQL.

- Hierarchical - queries look exactly like the data they return.

- Client-specified queries - the client has the liberty to dictate what to fetch from the server,

* Introspective - you can query the type system using the GraphQL syntax itself. This is great for parsing incoming data into strongly-typed interfaces, and not having to deal with parsing and manually transforming JSON into objects.
